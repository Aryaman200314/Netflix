                            Too much of wall-building is detrimental to the exercise of the ‘personal charisma’ of the leader whose presence should not be felt only through notices, circulars, or memos, but by being seen physically.

                            The individual and ever larger groups of individuals are beginning to see beneath the surface of the established order of things. It is this anti-progressive and anti-social spirit of the State and of the privileged castes which has been responsible for the bitter struggle between man and man. The long process of history has taught man that division and strife mean death, and that unity and cooperation advance his cause, multiply his strength and further his welfare

                            The sentence would read: "Loved and hated by thousands, Mr. Augustine may well be the most controversial physician ever to become surgeon general." Mr. Augustine's polarizing nature, being loved by some and hated by others, makes him controversial.

Acrimonious means bitter, harsh, or marked by strong hostility or resentment, which contrasts with the perceived insignificance of the issue.
